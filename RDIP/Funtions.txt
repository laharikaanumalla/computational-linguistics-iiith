Heading 
(Experiment)

Buttons and it's functionalities
 Dropdown Menu To (select one of the option)
Then it display form a setence (Declarative and interrogative or any other type) from the given words.
 (select the buttons in proper order)

Formed sentence (after selecting words):
"Re-form the sentence" (when the words are selected button is beging activated)
After clicking the "RE-form the sentence" button,the words returns to the same place.
They is other chance to reform the correct sentence (by reseleting the given button)

check the correctness of ths sentence:
By clicking the ON button
If the sentence is correct then it display RIGHT ANSWER!!!
If the sentence is wrong then it display   WRONG ANSWR!!!

Hide the correct sentence :
By clicking on this button is shows all possible correct answers

According to my knowledge I sugguest that it is better to include one more feature.
While selecting the button to form a correct sentence is somewhat difficult evrytime to re-form the sentence agian.
so it to change the selected button instead of re-form the sentence.
